Daifugo======Description-----------Daifugo is a Japanese card game in which players strategically try to get rid off all the cards in their hands.

Passwords are stored in plain text and a linear search algorithm is used for querying usernames. Before any new functionality is added, the Validator class needs to be refactored. The UI for the client needs a redesign.
